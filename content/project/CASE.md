This project was made in a group of three students for the Advanced Engineering Graphics Design course at Berkeley (E128). The objective of this project was to CAD and animate a moderately complex steam traction engine to accurately represent the mechanical motions and assembly of the vehicle.

Over 100 unique parts of the steam traction engine were modeled in PTC Creo based off engineering schematics found online. The final video was animated with Autodesk 3DS Max and consisted of 11,040 frames at a frame rate of 24 frames per second and a resolution of 1280x720. The total runtime of the video lasts 7:40.

The animation starts off with an exploded view of the steam traction engine, then follows a natural sequence of showing the different subassemblies to finally come back together to show the assembled vehicle. It video ends with an animation showing the mechanical processes that power the steam traction engine and all of the components working together to move the vehicle. Due to the nature of this project, time was a valuable resource â€“ requiring over 200 laborious hours just for rendering purposes. To view the animation, see: {{< youtube PDWSCiE8CtE >}}

*Learning outcomes of this project include: Learning different CAD software (Creo), animation fundamentals (in 3DS Max), reading and translating technical drawings, patience.*
