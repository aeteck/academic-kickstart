I joined the Human-Assistive Robotic Technologies (HART) Lab during the 2016 Fall semester. During this time, the lab was involved in a joint project with the Mechanical Systems Control (MSC) Lab to investigate an active-passive exoskeleton (APEX) capable of providing assistance to individuals suffering from muscoskeletal conditions. Namely, the labs were interested in creating a device to passively provide continuous assistance as opposed to active assistance to individuals who need help compressing and extending the arm.

I was placed in a group responsible for characterizing the stiffness response of the pneumatic cylinders being used for this device. To do this, a test rig was set up to control the cylinders which consisted of: Force-torque sensors, encoders, and a data acquisition (DAQ) system. My role included running numerous simulations using MATLAB and the physical hardware to create a model completely characterized by the initial conditions of the system. In addition, I trained a few people and created detailed documentation of results and procedures.

Though initial characterizations were created by way of theoretical models, we eventually created mathematical (numerical) models. This process consisted of simulation, data fitting, and fine adjusting to control and predict numerous states for the system. Conclusion from these tests allowed us to predict stiffness values, as this was the initial goal.
