# Biography

I am an analytic thinker and graduate from the University of California, Berkeley primarily interested in applying my theoretical and hands-on skills to the world of engineering. I have worked on numerous projects involving control systems, robotics, dynamics, manufacturing, and design. During my free time, I enjoy running, cycling, hiking, and reading.

As a student, I took part in the [UC Berkeley Human Powered Vehicle Team](https://hpv.berkeley.edu) and the [Human-Assistive Robotic Technologies](http://hart.berkeley.edu) laboratory where I applied and enhanced skills and interests involving: CAD, machine design, manufacturing, control theory, and data analysis. Additionally, I have taken extensive coursework in the areas of dynamics and control to further my interest and curiosity in these topics.

Currently, I [teach and mentor](http://coded.academy/) students in robotics, computer science, and information technology. Moreover, I am experimenting with and spearheading a rocketry program at the company for the [FAR-Mars Launch Contest](http://friendsofamateurrocketry.org/far-mars-launch-contest/).

Overall, I am involved in the lifelong pursuit of knowledge. To my friends and colleagues, I am known to be an exceptionally driven and organized individual, who has the staying power to deliver on lengthy or complex tasks. This website is intended to elaborate on my skillset by offering an in-depth view of some projects I have worked on.
